# Overview of the Data

The data in this report comes from a study of the risk factors associated with
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease among generally healthier older
adults. Specifically, this study enrolled a cohort of older (65+) and generally
healthy adults by randomly sampling individuals enrolled in the United States
Medicare system. Overall **`r nrow(mri)`** adults agreed to participate in the
study.


This report focuses on five variables from the study data. They are briefly
described below (see the study documentation for more details):

```{r variable-description}

var_desc <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Variable, ~Units, ~Description,
  "packyrs", "1 pack of cigarettes per day for 1 year", "Smoking history",
  "crt", "mg/dl", "Measure of creatinine in the participant's blood",
  "male", "0 = female, 1 = male", "Binary Indicator of patient sex",
  "obstime", "days", "Total time the participant was observed on the study",
  "death", "binary", "Indicator that the participant died during the study"
)

knitr::kable(var_desc, caption = "Variable Descriptions")

```
